\usage{
join_event_catch(
  start_year = 2002,
  end_year = 3000,
  survey_region = NA,
  tsn = NA,
  lhs = NA,
  gear = c("CAN", "Nor264"),
  trawl_method = "S",
  catch0 = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_year}{Optional filter for start year, valid range 2002 to present, defaults to 2002}

\item{end_year}{Optional filter for end year, valid range 2002 to present, defaults to 3000}

\item{survey_region}{Optional filter for survey region.  Defaults to all regions. Options are "SEBS", "NBS", "Chukchi", and "GOA"  Can take vector of multiple regions.
This filter is based on classification of large marine ecosystem and latitude with the separation between the Northern and Southern Bering Sea at 59.9 N
The seperation between NBS and Chukchi is at 65.5. Stations are sorted into region rather than survey objective (i.e. the survey
may be a survey to go to the "Chukchi", but if some stations occurred in the Northern Bering Sea those stations get classified as NBS stations).}

\item{tsn}{Filter for species taxonomic serial number (from ITIS.gov), defaults to all species in database. Can take vectors of species tsns.
This parameter is optional if catch0=FALSE, but is required if catch0=TRUE.  Use get_ema_taxonomy function to see full list of TSNs.}

\item{lhs}{Optional filter for species life history stage.  For salmon species, options are IM or J. For all other species, see values in EMA-lookup-table.}

\item{gear}{Optional filter for gear type, options are CAN, MAR, NETS156, Nor64, defaults to CAN & Nor64 (which are all surface trawls).
Can take vector of multiple gear types}

\item{trawl_method}{Optional filter for trawl or tow method (i.e. surface, midwater, oblique, live box (surface trawl with a live box), fishing power comparison, or diel tows)
See look up table for full explanation of category. Default to "S" or surface tow.}

\item{catch0}{Optional argument that indicates whether data should include 0-catches (i.e. stations that were fished where no species/lhs combinations were caught).
Defaults to false if no argument entered. However, when catch0 == FALSE it will give you any events where NOTHING was caught in the net}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of event information with catch data
}
\description{
This function queries and joins event and catch data hosted on AKFIN collected from Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment (EMA) surveys.
It includes parameters to control start and end year, gear type, survey region, trawl method, tsn (taxonomic serial number),
lhs code (life history stage), and whether or not to calculate catch0 (true/false)
